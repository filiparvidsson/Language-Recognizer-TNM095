# Langage Recognizer
Web based language recognizer using a Convolutional neural network. React front-end along with Python Backend, conntected using Flask.
The model is built in the Neural Network folder. I've excluded the data as it takes up too much space for github.

## Issues and bugs
Audio recorded from the mic is not working properly. The audio is not recorded correctly and the model is not able to recognize the language. The model works fine for audio files from Mozilla Common Voice.

## Lessons Learned
Make sure to use the correct Python environment when running the server.
